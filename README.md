# ✨ Open Source Contribution ✨

Welcome to this GitHub repository! If you're interested in learning how to collaborate on GitHub and make open source contributions, you're in the right place. This repository provides a simple guide to help you get started. Follow the steps below:

## Getting Started

1. 🍴 Fork this repository by clicking on the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
 
2. 📂 If you prefer, you can also add files directly on the GitHub web interface by navigating to the desired location within the repository and clicking on the "Add file" button. You can add any type of code or even create an `README.md` file to introduce yourself.

3. ✏️ Once you have made the changes or added the desired files, it's time to commit your changes. Provide a meaningful commit message that describes the changes you made. This will help others understand the purpose of your contribution.

4. 🔄 After committing your changes, navigate back to the main page of your forked repository on GitHub. You should see a notification indicating that you have recently made a commit. To contribute your changes back to the original repository, you need to create a pull request.

5. 🚀 Click on the "Pull Requests" tab near the top of the repository page. Then click on the green "New pull request" button. GitHub will compare the changes you made in your forked repository with the original repository, and you can review the differences before submitting the pull request.

6. 💡 Provide a clear and descriptive title for your pull request, along with a detailed description if necessary. This will help the repository owner and other contributors understand the purpose of your contribution.

7. ✔️ Once you are satisfied with your pull request, click on the "Create pull request" button. Congratulations! You have successfully completed your first contribution! 🥳
